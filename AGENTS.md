## MCP Agent Mail — coordination for multi-agent workflows

What it is
- A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources.
- Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations, with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

Why it's useful
- Prevents agents from stepping on each other with explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs.
- Keeps communication out of your token budget by storing messages in a per-project archive.
- Offers quick reads (`resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`) and macros that bundle common flows.

How to use effectively
1) Same repository
   - Register an identity: call `ensure_project`, then `register_agent` using this repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before you edit: `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)` to signal intent and avoid conflict.
   - Communicate with threads: use `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`; check inbox with `fetch_inbox` and acknowledge with `acknowledge_message`.
   - Read fast: `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20` or `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.
   - Tip: set `AGENT_NAME` in your environment so the pre-commit guard can block commits that conflict with others' active exclusive file reservations.
   - Tip: worktree mode (opt-in): set `WORKTREES_ENABLED=1`, and during trials set `AGENT_MAIL_GUARD_MODE=warn`. Check hooks with `mcp-agent-mail guard status .` and identity with `mcp-agent-mail mail status .`.

2) Across different repos in one project (e.g., Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)
   - Option A (single project bus): register both sides under the same `project_key` (shared key/path). Keep reservation patterns specific (e.g., `frontend/**` vs `backend/**`).
   - Option B (separate projects): each repo has its own `project_key`; use `macro_contact_handshake` or `request_contact`/`respond_contact` to link agents, then message directly. Keep a shared `thread_id` (e.g., ticket key) across repos for clean summaries/audits.

Macros vs granular tools
- Prefer macros when you want speed or are on a smaller model: `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
- Use granular tools when you need control: `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`.

### Worktree recipes (opt-in, non-disruptive)

- Enable gated features:
  - Set `WORKTREES_ENABLED=1` or `GIT_IDENTITY_ENABLED=1` in `.env` (do not commit secrets; config is loaded via `python-decouple`).
  - For trial posture, set `AGENT_MAIL_GUARD_MODE=warn` to surface conflicts without blocking.
- Inspect identity for a worktree:
  - CLI: `mcp-agent-mail mail status .`
  - Resource: `resource://identity/{/abs/path}` (available only when `WORKTREES_ENABLED=1`)
- Install guards (chain-runner friendly; honors `core.hooksPath` and Husky):
  - `mcp-agent-mail guard status .`
  - `mcp-agent-mail guard install <project_key> . --prepush`
  - Guards exit early when `WORKTREES_ENABLED=0` or `AGENT_MAIL_BYPASS=1`.
- Composition details:
  - Installer writes a Python chain-runner to `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and `.git/hooks/pre-push` that executes `hooks.d/<hook>/*` and then `<hook>.orig` if present.
  - Agent Mail guard is installed as `hooks.d/pre-commit/50-agent-mail.py` and `hooks.d/pre-push/50-agent-mail.py`.
  - On Windows, `.cmd` and `.ps1` shims are written alongside the chain-runner to invoke Python.
- Reserve before you edit:
  - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`
  - Patterns use Git pathspec semantics and respect repository `core.ignorecase`.

### Git-based identity: precedence and migration

- Precedence (when gate is on):
  1) Committed marker `.agent-mail-project-id`
  2) Discovery YAML `.agent-mail.yaml` with `project_uid:`
  3) Private marker `.git/agent-mail/project-id`
  4) Remote fingerprint: normalized `origin` + default branch
  5) `git-common-dir` or path hash
- Migration helpers (CLI):
  - Write committed marker: `mcp-agent-mail projects mark-identity . --commit`
  - Scaffold discovery YAML: `mcp-agent-mail projects discovery-init . --product <product_uid>`

### Guard usage quickstart

- Set your identity for local commits:
  - Export `AGENT_NAME="YourAgentName"` in the shell that performs commits.
- Pre-commit:
  - Scans staged changes (`git diff --cached --name-status -M -z`) and blocks conflicts with others’ active exclusive reservations.
- Pre-push:
  - Enumerates to-be-pushed commits (`git rev-list`) and diffs trees (`git diff-tree --no-ext-diff -z`) to catch conflicts not staged locally.
- Advisory mode:
  - With `AGENT_MAIL_GUARD_MODE=warn`, conflicts are printed with rich context and push/commit proceeds.

### Build slots for long-running tasks

- Acquire a slot (advisory):
  - `acquire_build_slot(project_key, agent_name, "frontend-build", ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`
- Keep it fresh during the run:
  - `renew_build_slot(project_key, agent_name, "frontend-build", extend_seconds=1800)`
- Release when done (non-destructive; marks released):
  - `release_build_slot(project_key, agent_name, "frontend-build")`
- Tips:
  - Combine with `mcp-agent-mail amctl env --path . --agent $AGENT_NAME` to get `CACHE_KEY` and `ARTIFACT_DIR`.
  - Use `mcp-agent-mail am-run <slot> -- <cmd...>` to run with prepped env; flags include `--ttl-seconds`, `--shared/--exclusive`, and `--block-on-conflicts`. Future versions will auto-acquire/renew/release.

### Product Bus

- Create or ensure a product:
  - `mcp-agent-mail products ensure MyProduct --name "My Product"`
- Link a repo/worktree into the product (use slug or path):
  - `mcp-agent-mail products link MyProduct .`
- View product status and linked projects:
  - `mcp-agent-mail products status MyProduct`
- Search messages across all linked projects:
  - `mcp-agent-mail products search MyProduct "bd-123 OR \"release plan\"" --limit 50`
- Product-wide inbox for an agent:
  - `mcp-agent-mail products inbox MyProduct YourAgent --limit 50 --urgent-only --include-bodies`
- Product-wide thread summarization:
  - `mcp-agent-mail products summarize-thread MyProduct "bd-123" --per-thread-limit 100 --no-llm`

Server tools (for orchestrators)
- `ensure_product(product_key|name)`
- `products_link(product_key, project_key)`
- `resource://product/{key}`
- `search_messages_product(product_key, query, limit=20)`

Common pitfalls
- "from_agent not registered": always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first.
- "FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT": adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use a non-exclusive reservation when appropriate.
- Auth errors: if JWT+JWKS is enabled, include a bearer token with a `kid` that matches server JWKS; static bearer is used only when JWT is disabled.

## Integrating with Beads (dependency‑aware task planning)

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency‑aware issue database and a CLI (`bd`) for selecting “ready work,” setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail’s messaging, audit trail, and file‑reservation signals. Project: [steveyegge/beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)

Recommended conventions
- **Single source of truth**: Use **Beads** for task status/priority/dependencies; use **Agent Mail** for conversation, decisions, and attachments (audit).
- **Shared identifiers**: Use the Beads issue id (e.g., `bd-123`) as the Mail `thread_id` and prefix message subjects with `[bd-123]`.
- **Reservations**: When starting a `bd-###` task, call `file_reservation_paths(...)` for the affected paths; include the issue id in the `reason` and release on completion.

Typical flow (agents)
1) **Pick ready work** (Beads)
   - `bd ready --json` → choose one item (highest priority, no blockers)
2) **Reserve edit surface** (Mail)
   - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="bd-123")`
3) **Announce start** (Mail)
   - `send_message(..., thread_id="bd-123", subject="[bd-123] Start: <short title>", ack_required=true)`
4) **Work and update**
   - Reply in‑thread with progress and attach artifacts/images; keep the discussion in one thread per issue id
5) **Complete and release**
   - `bd close bd-123 --reason "Completed"` (Beads is status authority)
   - `release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])`
   - Final Mail reply: `[bd-123] Completed` with summary and links

Mapping cheat‑sheet
- **Mail `thread_id`** ↔ `bd-###`
- **Mail subject**: `[bd-###] …`
- **File reservation `reason`**: `bd-###`
- **Commit messages (optional)**: include `bd-###` for traceability

Event mirroring (optional automation)
- On `bd update --status blocked`, send a high‑importance Mail message in thread `bd-###` describing the blocker.
- On Mail “ACK overdue” for a critical decision, add a Beads label (e.g., `needs-ack`) or bump priority to surface it in `bd ready`.

Pitfalls to avoid
- Don’t create or manage tasks in Mail; treat Beads as the single task queue.
- Always include `bd-###` in message `thread_id` to avoid ID drift across tools.

### ast-grep vs ripgrep (quick guidance)

**Use `ast-grep` when structure matters.** It parses code and matches AST nodes, so results ignore comments/strings, understand syntax, and can **safely rewrite** code.

* Refactors/codemods: rename APIs, change import forms, rewrite call sites or variable kinds.
* Policy checks: enforce patterns across a repo (`scan` with rules + `test`).
* Editor/automation: LSP mode; `--json` output for tooling.

**Use `ripgrep` when text is enough.** It’s the fastest way to grep literals/regex across files.

* Recon: find strings, TODOs, log lines, config values, or non‑code assets.
* Pre-filter: narrow candidate files before a precise pass.

**Rule of thumb**

* Need correctness over speed, or you’ll **apply changes** → start with `ast-grep`.
* Need raw speed or you’re just **hunting text** → start with `rg`.
* Often combine: `rg` to shortlist files, then `ast-grep` to match/modify with precision.

**Snippets**

Find structured code (ignores comments/strings):

```bash
ast-grep run -l TypeScript -p 'import $X from "$P"'
```

Codemod (only real `var` declarations become `let`):

```bash
ast-grep run -l JavaScript -p 'var $A = $B' -r 'let $A = $B' -U
```

Quick textual hunt:

```bash
rg -n 'console\.log\(' -t js
```

Combine speed + precision:

```bash
rg -l -t ts 'useQuery\(' | xargs ast-grep run -l TypeScript -p 'useQuery($A)' -r 'useSuspenseQuery($A)' -U
```

**Mental model**

* Unit of match: `ast-grep` = node; `rg` = line.
* False positives: `ast-grep` low; `rg` depends on your regex.
* Rewrites: `ast-grep` first-class; `rg` requires ad‑hoc sed/awk and risks collateral edits.

### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.

- bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.
- bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.
- bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.
- bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.
- bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.
- bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.

Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.

## UBS Quick Reference for AI Agents

UBS stands for "Ultimate Bug Scanner": **The AI Coding Agent's Secret Weapon: Flagging Likely Bugs for Fixing Early On**

**Install:** `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/master/install.sh | bash`

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

**Commands:**
```bash
ubs file.ts file2.py                    # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs --only=js,python src/               # Language filter (3-5x faster)
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning .            # CI mode — before PR
ubs --help                              # Full command reference
ubs sessions --entries 1                # Tail the latest install session log
ubs .                                   # Whole project (ignores things like .venv and node_modules automatically)
```

**Output Format:**
```
⚠️  Category (N errors)
    file.ts:42:5 – Issue description
    💡 Suggested fix
Exit code: 1
```
Parse: `file:line:col` → location | 💡 → how to fix | Exit 0/1 → pass/fail

**Fix Workflow:**
1. Read finding → category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` → view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` → exit 0
6. Commit

**Speed Critical:** Scope to changed files. `ubs src/file.ts` (< 1s) vs `ubs .` (30s). Never full scan for small edits.

**Bug Severity:**
- **Critical** (always fix): Null safety, XSS/injection, async/await, memory leaks
- **Important** (production): Type narrowing, division-by-zero, resource leaks
- **Contextual** (judgment): TODO/FIXME, console logs

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Ignore findings → ✅ Investigate each
- ❌ Full scan per edit → ✅ Scope to file
- ❌ Fix symptom (`if (x) { x.y }`) → ✅ Root cause (`x?.y`)
